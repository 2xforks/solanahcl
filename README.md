This is the Solana Hardware Compatibility List for running a mainnet validator

## Hardware Recommendations

The hardware recommendations below are provided as a guide.  Operators are encouraged to do their own performance testing.

| Component | Validator Requirements | Additional RPC Node Requirements |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **CPU**   | - 2.8GHz base clock speed, or faster<br />- SHA extensions instruction support<br />- AMD Gen 3 or newer<br />- Intel Ice Lake or newer<br />- Higher clock speed is preferable over more cores<br />- AVX2 instruction support (to use official release binaries, self-compile otherwise)<br />- Support for AVX512f is helpful<br />||
| | 12 cores / 24 threads, or more  | 16 cores / 32 threads, or more |
| **RAM**   | Error Correction Code (ECC) memory is suggested<br />Motherboard with 512GB capacity suggested ||
| | 256GB or more| 512 GB or more for **all [account indexes](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-an-rpc-node#account-indexing)** |
| **Disk**  | PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD, or better, on each of: <br />- **Accounts**: 500GB, or larger. High TBW (Total Bytes Written)<br />- **Ledger**: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested<br />- **Snapshots**: 250GB or larger. High TBW suggested<br />- **OS**: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK<br /><br />The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk<br /><br />Accounts and ledger *can* be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended<br /><br />The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community | Consider a larger ledger disk if longer transaction history is required<br /><br />Accounts and ledger **should not** be stored on the same disk |
| **GPUs**  | Not necessary at this time<br />Operators in the validator community do not use GPUs currently | |
